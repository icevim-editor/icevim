# IceVim

IceVim is a Neovim-fork focused on stability. For more information, read [MANIFESTO.md](MANIFESTO.md).

## Installing IceVim

The commands to install the dependencies are listed [here](https://neovim.io/doc/build/#build-prerequisites).

After installing the dependencies, run `build.sh`.

## About Plugin Managers

We expect you keep a lockfile and only update plugins if you think they didn't
break compatibility. This is because in the far future (in a few months or
    years) we expect the latest versions of many plugins to stop working.

Please do not submit any issues about this when that happens.
